## Vision

**What is the vision of this product?**

A simple method to assess how much food the dog requires daily based upon its current weight and dietary needs.

**What pain point does this project solve?**

The variability of calorie density from food to food and how to make sense of all of that by using mass as a means to accurately feed your animal. Tools that calculate food amount based on mass rather than food volume are difficult to find (dog food companies and even veterinarians recommend feeding by volume versus mass). This tool gives dog owners an assurance that they are feeding their family-member the amount of food that will lead to the most ideal weight, and ultimately, healthy lifestyle.

**Why should we care about your product?**

Because we all want to have healthy animals who lead happy actualized lives. Or if our		animals need to lose weight or gain weight, we can find a suggested path to a healthy size.
