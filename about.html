				<h3>Liliane Lendvai</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>Hello, and I’m Liliane, a current Software Development Student at Code Fellows. I’m pursuing a career in software development, as I believe that coding is a way to level the playing field, as there’s code in nearly every facet of our lives now. With more people understanding coding, we’ll have more of a say in how things are being made and the subsequent impact it has on our lives. My prior experience includes several years as an executive recruiter, where I witnessed the immense benefits of bringing together diverse talent and perspectives. I received both a BA and MBA from California State University San Marcos.</p>

				<h3>Tyler Main</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>Hello my name is Tyler Main. I've spent the last 10 years in the content creation and communications field. I decided to pursue software development to give myself a more clear and promising career path that challenges me, suits some of my strengths and gives me flexibility. My focus has been on JavaScript due to the demand for the language and its application in the web and app development process but I’ll always have a soft spot for anything to do with design elements. I'd love to work on a team developing products related to outdoor recreation, athletics or music.</p>
